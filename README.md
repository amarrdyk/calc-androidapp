# calc-androidapp
This is my very first android application made usingÂ android Studio. It's entirely made of Java.

The source code is available in the 'src' folder named as "MainActivity.java". This is the very simple application runs on java consisting of size 5MB. The code which is available on the internet is quite different to ours when it comes to handling errors. 
This one makes use of java packages and exception handling and lets user to calculate the expressions consisting upto two terms. 

> For the expression: 20+21
